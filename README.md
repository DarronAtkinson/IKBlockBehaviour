# IKBlockBehaviour

Restricts the right hand IK position to an arc around a FinalIK biped character.</br>
Allows multiple arcs to be defined, which was used to provide automatic blocking functionality for the character.</br>
In the prototype the enemy character would launch an attack and the player would move their arm to block the incoming attack.</br>
The attack stored the arc index and position on the arc that would be considered a perfect block.
